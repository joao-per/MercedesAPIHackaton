# INSTACAR

Welcome, tech enthusiasts, developers, and car aficionados! 

Instacar is envisioned as an Instagram clone, but with a twist. Our platform is aimed
specifically at the new generations of car enthusiasts, who harbor a deep passion for
everything automobile. Instacar will serve as the perfect digital garage where
like-minded people can connect, share their experiences, showcase their vehicles,
and delve into the fascinating world of cars.

This solution focused on the core features that make Instagram so popular:
sharing high-quality images, creating and maintaining user profiles, curating and
following feeds, and enabling interactions through likes and comments. 


The ECLASS Team shared, brainstormed ideas and showcased her technical prowess,
creativity, and love for cars to build INSTACAR. 

We believe as a Team, the inspiring platform would build a new generation
of car enthusiasts worldwide

Future AddOn: To make this more flexible, enabling the application to support
music, videos, and some of the other advanced features that Instagram exhibits would be nice.
